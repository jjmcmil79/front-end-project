# front-end-project
Front End project for Galvanize Level-up Program MCSP-12

1. Enter a city
2. Page returns the current weather for the city and a 7 day forecast. Currently the page will only pull the first search result from the get request for that city name.
3. It also changes the background photo for the current conditions category ( Rain, Snow, Clear, Fog, Clouds, Mist)

I will continue to add features to this project in the future.
